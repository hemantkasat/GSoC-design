![Alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hemantkasat/GSoC-design/master/PitchStairCase/pitchstaircase.png)

As can be seen in the image it consist of play, export, button for choosing instrument and close 
button. We have a slider to slide through the sliding area having frequency division ( pitch division).

For division we can either show the absolute frequency of the sound or we can show the notes like (    
C, D etc. ) . Or we can show notes and absolute frequency both at the same time.
